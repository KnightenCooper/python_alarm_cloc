# Overview

The alarm clock I created utilizes the time, playsound, sys, threading, random, and codecs modules to successfully operate. At the present moment, my alarm clock is operated using a custom command-line-interface and has additional features besides telling the time and setting alarm. Users can also input their own favorite quotes that are then stored into a txt file. My program successfully reads and writes from the txt file to display a random quote from the file. The alarm clock I created also can handle multiple alarms simultaneously because I implemented threading. 

My goal with this project was to create a working alarm clock. I was interested in the logic necessary to determine when the alarm would sound. I am working to further my learning of Python and wanted to get some more hands-on experience with Python. I was able to gain a greater understanding of how to use different Python modules, variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, data structures, threading, and how to reading and writing to a txt file using Python. I hope to be able to use the knowledge I gained about Python to further my career as a software engineer.

# Development Environment

To create this program I used VS Code running on Windows operating system. I also took learned from the official python documentation, w3schools, stackoverflow, tutorialspoint, geeksforgeeks, and many other websites.

This program was created using Python 3.9.7 64-bit and the utilizes the time, playsound, sys, threading, random, and codecs python modules.

# Future Work

* I would love to make a GUI for this alarm clock. I did some testing with the ptinter module and it shows promise.
* A feature that I would love to add is the ability for the user to select between different alarm sounds, or record their own.
* The alarm currently only beeps once when it goes off. It would be excellent if the alarm continued to beep until the user disabled it. This would also include a snooze button.
* I would love to connect this to my raspberry pi and have it turn on the lights or a fan instead of using sound to wake me up.
